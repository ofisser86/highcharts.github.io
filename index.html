             <h2 class="text-center"> TIOBE Index for September 2017</h2>
<h3>September Headline: For how long will the big three (Java, C, C++) dominate the index?</h3>

<p> Nothing  changed in the top 3 of the TIOBE index for more than 15 years. The big three programming languages Java, C, C++ are still where they were in 2001: at position 1, 2 and 3. C# and Python were believed to become the next big programming languages, but they didn't make it (yet). C# is not a top 3 language because its adoption in the non-Windows world is still low. Python on the other hand is dynamically typed, which is a blocker for most large and/or critical software systems to use it. Having said that, the gap between the big three and the rest is closing quickly. But the candidates for the top 3 are losing market share as well, so it is unknown what is going to happen. The general trend is that the pack is getting bigger. Applications that are written in a single programming language are getting rarer nowadays. As a consequence, more and more languages are gaining popularity down the TIOBE index. So exciting times are ahead of us to see what languages will be the winners of the next few years.</p>

<p>The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.</p>

        <p>The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.</p>

<p>Rest and vacation are often seen as luxuries or indulgences. With an ever-growing workload and constant pressure to get ahead, we’re fighting just to keep up. There doesn’t seem to be room for rest or time off in the modern workday.
        
        <p>But rest isn’t a luxury. It’s absolutely critical to doing your best work, and staying healthy. People who don’t take time off from work have a higher risk of heart attack and depression. There’s also a correlation between taking vacation and being promoted—possibly due to the positive outlook and increased productivity that come from vacation time.</p>
        
                <p>Downtime also helps our bodies recover, so we take fewer sick days (costing our companies less money), and it increases our ability to think creatively.c</p>
        
                        <p>If you’re struggling to make time off a priority in your company, here are three ways to change that.</p>
